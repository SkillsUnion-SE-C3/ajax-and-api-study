## Questions

1. What is Ajax? What advantages and disadvantages does it brings?

   ```
   Ajax is a client-side script that communicates to and from a server/database without the need for a postback or a complete page refresh.
pros: 
request are asynchronous, the user does not have to wait for the request processing to complete.
useful for real-time applications.
improves speed and performance when fetching data from the database and storing data into a database

cons: 
relies on JavaScript. If JavaScript is disabled, the AJAX application won't work.
Harder to debug
Very bad for SEO; Search engines like Google, Yahoo, Bing etc. cannot easily index the AJAX pages
   ```

2. Explain the differences between XMLHttpRequest, Fetch and Axios.

   ```
   XMLHttpRequests - is the oldest and is more complicated to code for. It also requires callbacks for responses
Fetch  - is the newest and easier to code. It does not support cookies or timeouts which both require additional coding for
Axios - is an easy to use and has a large browser support without issues. 
   ```

3. Which of the three has the poorest browser support - XMLHttpRequest (XHR), Fetch and Axios?
